Used this to check if I could use this trick to filter out 0 from 0.0 values in calculated columns

-- Null values in this table represented with the number 0 instead of NULL. 
-- Employer names, IDs, and sizes, as well as "current name" columns are filled out without nulls.
-- Some informative cells about employer contact info missing, but at minimal rates. 
-- Up to nearly 40% of calculated statistical values have multiple rows of seemingly null data. 
-- Having read the "Making Your Calculations" page on gov.uk's website, it seems that the calculated values are done as percentages with 2 decimal places. For this reason, I'm considering values here as non-null if they are equal to 0.0, and null when just 0.
-- After accounting for these, there is still up to 33% null in the calculated rows. Specifically, it is the mean and median bonus percent columns that have the most null values. Overall the data here is likely still usable but these will have to be taken into consideration.

--BONUS QUESTION: 
-- From searching on the gov.uk and UK Office for National Statistics websites, SIC stands for Standard Industrial Classification and codifies a company's "Nature of business". Corresponds to what industry a company is in.


-- THE UK-WIDE PAY GAP
-- 5. Choose which column you will use to calculate the pay gap. 
--Will you use DiffMeanHourlyPercent or DiffMedianHourlyPercent? Can you justify your choice?

SELECT diffmeanhourlypercent, diffmedianhourlypercent --PREFER MEDIAN
FROM gender_pay_gap_21_22
WHERE (diffmeanhourlypercent < 0) OR (diffmedianhourlypercent < 0)


-- According to gov.uk website, the calculated average values will return either as positive or negative values
-- Positive percentage show that women have a lower pay/bonus than men in the company
-- Negative percentage show that men have a lower pay/bonus than women in the company
-- Zero percentage shows that there is equal pay/bonus between men and women. 
-- Ex (from website): If the calculated mean results in 13.59%, then women are paid 13.59% less than men. 

-- While both columns are useful, I prefer to use median, because it will give a more realistic look at the entire pool of employees. Mean might be useful in certain cases, but it could skew data significantly based on a small number of high ranking employees, ex: C-suite. While there is indeed a worthwhile conversation on gender bias within C-suite employees, they do not represent the majority of employees in an organization, and these are the ones who will suffer the material impacts of positive/negative gender bias in pay.

-- 7. What are some caveats we need to be aware of when reporting the figure we've just calculated?
-- Using this average value is a bit generalizing. It doesn't represent account for relative percent of men and women in different industries (though in turn there's an argument to be made about devaluation of salary as fields become more saturated with women)

-- 9. What do you notice about the results? Are these well-known companies?
-- These companies don't appear to be large, well-known companies. Ran a quick addition to the previous query to check their size and it seems like they're all relatively small. It could be that these are in more male dominated insustries, as some of the name results suggest these companies are in construction and similar fields.

-- 11. How would you report on the results? Can we say that these companies are engaging in unlawful pay discrimination?
-- From the data provided, we can see that the top 10 companies with pay gaps skewed towards men have earnings from 77% to 100% higher than the female employees. These companies are all relatively small. The top two companies that have a 100% higher salary for males than females appear to have majority male employees across all pay quartiles. What is more interesting, however, are the companies with equal numbers of male and female employees in each quartile or with more female employees in each quartile, as this implies a large discrepancy somewhere in median earnings.
-- It is difficult to say whether or not these companies are engaging in unlawful pay discrimination. From the gov.uk website, it is described that company calculations are focused mostly on full-time employees, so this data could be very limited with respect to its information on contract and part-time workers. Considering that these industries include construction and healthcare, and considering the relative small-size of the companies shown, there may be many employees with irregular hours that are not being accounted for, and more investigation would need to be conducted before determining if thre indeed was unlawful practice.

-- Overall, it appears that the smaller the company, the greater the pay_gap. The only exception is companies with less than 250 employees, which ranks third among the 6 groups, as opposed to last. The reporting rules differed for companies of this size compared to others, so this might explain the discrepancy. It could also be that there's more of a distribution of different types of companies, independent companies, etc. where there might be more outliers in one direction or another with respect to employee ratios. Smaller companies could also be using more contract work and part-time employees, which may also have an impact on the pay gap.
